üì± App Structure
This app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, which separates UI logic from business logic. Here's a breakdown of the structure:

Model
SongEntity: Contains data for individual songs (title, artist, path).
SongViewModel: Manages the logic of playing songs, navigating through the playlist, and managing repeat modes.
View
HomeFragment: Displays a list of available songs.
SongPlaying Activity: Handles the playback UI and controls (play/pause, repeat mode).
ViewModel
LiveData: Observes changes to song data and repeat mode, automatically updating the UI.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Kotlin: The primary programming language for Android development.
Android SDK: For creating Android apps.
Room Database: Local database for storing song metadata.
LiveData: To observe data changes and update the UI reactively.
MediaPlayer: For audio playback.
RecyclerView: To display songs in a list.

‚öôÔ∏è How to Use
1. Add Music
Tap on the "Add Song" button to browse your device and add songs.

2. Play Music
Tap on a song in the list to start playing it.
Use the play/pause button to control playback.
Seek through the track using the seek bar.

3. Repeat Modes
Toggle between repeat modes by tapping the Repeat button:
No Repeat: The song will stop after it finishes.
Repeat One: The current song will repeat indefinitely.
Repeat All: The playlist will repeat after reaching the last song.

Home Screen: Displays the list of available songs.
Player Screen: Displays the current song and playback controls.
